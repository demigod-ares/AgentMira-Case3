## Agent Mira Hackathon Case Study: Real Estate Chatbot
🚀 Build a full-stack chatbot that helps users find homes based on their preferences.
The chatbot will fetch and merge data from multiple JSON sources, filter properties based on user input, and display relevant results.

## 📌 Case Study Requirements

### 💡 Goal
Develop a real estate chatbot using JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js that:
- ✅ Accepts user input (budget, location, number of bedrooms, etc.).
- ✅ Retrieves and merges data from three separate JSON files.
- ✅ Filters and displays relevant properties in a user-friendly interface.
- ✅ Stores user preferences (saved properties) in MongoDB.
- ✅ Deploys the solution on a cloud platform or GitHub Pages.

### 📂 Data Structure
The candidate will work with three separate JSON files, simulating real-world multiple data sources.
- 1️⃣ Property Basics (property_basics.json) which contains ID, title, price, and location.
- 2️⃣ Property Characteristics (property_characteristics.json) which contains bedrooms, bathrooms, size, and amenities.
